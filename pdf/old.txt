Syrocase Escape from Alcatraz game
=====================
THE STORYLINE
====================
The federal prison of Alcatraz, surrounded by the waters of San Francisco Bay, housed some of America's most dangerous and notorious felons. Escaping Alcatraz is no easy feat, and the few that have tried were unsuccessful. As guards in the nation's strongest prison, it is your duty to uphold Alcatraz's stalwart reputation.

THE PLOT
====================
The guards are so used to you and your library cart that they hardly watch as you move from cell to cell. Using this to your advantage, you have found inmates with access to other parts of the facilities and have come up with the plan that will get you out of your cell, and off this miserable rock.

YOUR MISSION
====================
Prison protocol indicates that you have 60 minutes to locate and return all of the Warden's keys or the prison will have to go into lockdown. If you are able to find the keys in time, you will have to complete an additional investigation to find the prisoner who stole the keys, and make sure they pay for their crime.
