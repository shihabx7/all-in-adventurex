                                      Over the past several years, escape rooms have grown significantly
                                       in popularity as more and more people are seeking out creative, socially-based ways
                                        to spend quality time with family, friends, and co-workers. An escape room is
                                         an exciting and adventurous (live) game in which participants are "locked" into
                                          a themed room with their team (usually 10 - 12 people), and they must race against
                                           the clock to <b>solve puzzles, riddles, and clues in order to navigate their way out
                                            of the room - BEFORE THE TIME RUNS OUT!</b>
                                      </p>

                                      There is often a time limit of 50 - 60 minutes to solve every puzzle before "escaping" the room.
                                       If the time expires before all clues are figured out, then unfortunately - it's game over.
                                        However, you can always try your luck again with a different themed room because

                                      Online Escape Rooms are games specially designed for online audiences.
                                       Remote participants/groups work together virtually (online) to decipher
                                        clues, riddles and puzzles through a virtual escape room environment.
                                         Without a game host serving as guide, online players must work together - pointing
                                          and clicking their way through as they attempt to escape the room. Online Escapes
                                           tend not to have time limits and can be played anywhere, at any time - making

                                      Escape rooms are essentially puzzle-based games that started off as interactive video games.
                                       The first video game escape rooms were called Crimson Room and Myst, and they were made by
                                        Japanese video game companies around 2004. These games fall under the category of point-and-click games,
                                         and the goal is very simple - to get out of a locked room using everything at your disposal,
                                          mainly clues, and intuition. Very soon, the developers and the fans of the game realized these
                                           games could be transformed into real-life adventure games, with rooms that are custom made to
                                            look like the ones from the video games.

                                      In 2007, the very first real-life escape room game was created by SCRAP,
                                       a Japanese company. The room's name was "Origin" and it was inspired by the detective
                                        mystery novels of Agatha Christie. It didn't take long before this trend started spreading around the world.
                                         Hungary was the first European country to open an escape room.

                                      After that, around 2012, we could see the beginnings of the escape room craze in the US.
                                       They started off as relatively bland rooms with no real design thought put into them,
                                        but only a few years later the US started opening some of the best escape rooms in the world.
                                         Now, there are literally thousands of these rooms scattered across the world waiting
                                          for you to solve them.

                                      Finally, their popularity has gone beyond just playing the games.
                                       For instance, the Science Channel made a TV show in 2015 called Race to Escape, and it's based on the escape room games.

                                      <b>No photos or videos:</b> Guests are allowed to bring their personal cell devices in the room, however,
                                       as a courtesy we ask you not to take photos/videos of All In Adventures rooms, clues and props.
                                        Escape rooms are all about the mystery and the big reveal, so taking photos/videos (to potentially share/post socially)
                                         would ruin the game for other/future patrons.

                                      <b>No excessive force:</b> There are plenty of doors, boxes and hidden compartments in escape rooms,
                                       but they are all designed to be opened without force. As a rule of thumb, if you have to strain
                                        to open one of our clues/props, this most likely means it isn't supposed to opened. No worries
                                         - everything is designed to be easily accessed (once you figure out where it is).

                                      <b>Clues are allowed:</b> Sometimes sorting through an escape room can be difficult and you can get stuck
                                       on a particularly brain teasing clue or puzzle. Rather than waste precious time, you can simply
                                        buzz your Game Master for a hint. (They'll explain how to use the buzzer before the game begins).
                                         While some players seem to enjoy trying to escape without ANY hints or assistance, there are those

                                                This goes without saying but answers to hidden clues aren't exactly obvious or overt.

                                               quickly tick away - especially when your team is struggling to find clues. The best advice we
                                                can offer is just don't give up! Not everyone/team escapes the room before time runs out,

                                      horror movie series is a fictionalized account of an escape room adventure. Released by Sony in 2019, the first film features
                                       a group of contestants who compete for a major cash prize in a terrifying series of escape rooms. The sequel "Escape Room:
                                        Tournament of Champions" (2021) follows a group of six people trying to survive a new series of more deadly escape rooms.
